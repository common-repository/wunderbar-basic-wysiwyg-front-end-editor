Wunderbar Basic is a WYSIWYG front-end editor for virtually any WordPress site and theme which puts full-featured visual editing on every page.

== Description ==

Edit your pages in WYSIWYG, right from the pages of your website, with a full set of formatting tools that work just like a word processor.  You make your changes right on the page itself – not from the back-end admin – so you can see exactly what your fonts, colors, styles, links, tables, and images will look like. 

When you visit a website page with content you want to change, click the Wunderbar cursor. We add a formatting bar  at the top of the page with a full set of word-processing-style options. You just start typing and styling. Editing visually inside your page means you can be certain that What You'll Get is What You See. When finished, click the SAVE button. No more visits to WordPress admin to update things. You're in and out in seconds – site changes have never been smoother, simpler, or faster.

Wunderbar Basic allows editing of Wordpress page content with multiple levels of undo. A working demo of the full version of The Wunderbar can be tried at http://terra-virtua.com.

The Wunderbar and Wunderbar Basic even work with Gutenberg! Gutenberg's modular back-end editor is a big step from the traditional Wordpress editor, but Gutenberg doesn't allow you to edit in place while you're looking at your pages in context. The Wunderbar does just that, while retaining the hidden comments that make Gutenberg formatting happen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wunderbar` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
